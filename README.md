About the project:

In this project, the likelihood of unbanked prepaid debit card users to open a bank account in the near future is examined. 

About the Dataset:

An empirical analysis of data from the 2013 to 2017 rounds of the FDIC Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households is perfomed. Banking history, attitudes about banking, and the use of other alternative financial services (AFS) for check-cashing, money order, 
or remittance transactions, and credit. The full pooled sample for this study consists of 6,178 respondents who were all unbanked when they were interviewed. 

About the empirical model: 

Testing the hypothesis that prepaid debit card use by the unbanked is a precursor to opening a bank account in an endogenous seemingly unrelated (SUR) bivariate probit model
