**About the project:**

Along with an increase in prepaid card use in the U.S. from 2013 to 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) found that users in each banking category, fully banked, underbanked, and unbanked, also increased (FDIC, 2018). During the aftermath of the global financial crisis, prepaid debit cards became useful instruments to help budget expenses and control spending (Hernandez et al., 2017). Unbanked users could stay out of debt and avoid overdraft fees because they could not exceed their balances (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2015; Regions Bank, 2020). In this project, the likelihood of unbanked prepaid debit card users to open a bank account in the near future is examined. 

**About the Dataset:**

An empirical analysis of data from the 2013 to 2017 rounds of the FDIC Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households is perfomed. Banking history, attitudes about banking, and the use of other alternative financial services (AFS) for check-cashing, money order, or remittance transactions, and credit. The full pooled sample for this study consists of 6,178 respondents who were all unbanked when they were interviewed. 

**About the empirical model:**

The hypothesis that prepaid debit card use by the unbanked is a precursor to opening a bank account is tested using an endogenous seemingly unrelated (SUR) bivariate probit model. We hypothesize that prepaid debit card use is positively related to the intention to open a bank account.
